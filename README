Description:

Run the "make" command
$make #this creates executable called "normal_web_server"
No run the executable
$./normal_web_server PORT_NO
this command starts the server at given port
In the program the main contains method called "make_socket(port)"
this method takes our INPUT(port_no) as parameter and creates a socket at that port.
socket and port and binded in the make socket method.
In the main server is pushed into listen state and can handle 1000 clients.
Now, the server is in LISTEN state.
When a client  makes a request the server accepts it.
parses the request to find the version(HTTP 1.1) and type of request(GET).
checks whether the client who made the request supports gzip encoding or not in gzip_support function.
Then the request is parsed(decoded) and the command is excuted at the server side with the help of "popen()".
the response is then constructed with respective header information and sent to client.
This is the flow of my program.
